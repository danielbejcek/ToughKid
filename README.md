# Welcome to my first project ToughKid.

This project took me around 2-3 months of work with close to zero experience,
please understand that this code is a work of an enthusiast and a amateur.

The idea behind this project was to release pressure and save valuable time of shift managers,
who need to distribute specific positions to relevant employees.

Up until now, every manager in our small company needed to come to work earlier to sit behind a computer and collect data
about employees, who are supposed to work on that specific shift from Google Sheets table.
Then he needed to look for every employee who has a 'X' symbol next to his name
and after that, copy all of those names into a final table, which he then proceeded to take a picture of and share it in a WhatsApp group.

This small application will make their lives easier, everything is combine into this small pocket project.

This App pulls data from Google Sheets table automatically and allows the user the fill the table without the need to verify,
if the employee in-fact works that day.

Along this long process of creating this app, I have been using getting alot of help, mainly from Stack Overflow, Youtube, Github and google overall.
This app is then finalized and complied trough usage of Buildozer and Windows Subsystem for Linux.
